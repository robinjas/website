    <h2>Welcome to Galena</h2>
    <p>
        Hidden in the northwest corner of Illinois, Galena is a living museum of 19th-century architecture, offering a
        view into a bygone era with its well-preserved buildings and charming streets. This picturesque town, once a
        booming lead mining community in the early 19th century, played a pivotal role in the economic development of Illinois.
        Its rich deposits of lead brought wealth and rapid growth, making it one of the most important settlements in the state during that period.
