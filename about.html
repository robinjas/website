    <h2>Fun fact!</h2>
    <p>
        Did you know that Illinois is known as the "Land of Lincoln" because it was the home of President Abraham Lincoln
        before he became president? Lincoln moved to Illinois in 1830 and later practiced law in Springfield. The state's
        rich history includes its pivotal role in shaping American politics and society.
